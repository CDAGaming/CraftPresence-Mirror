## v1.5.6 (06/24/2019)

### Changes:

* The Default KeyBind to access the Config GUI is now the Grave (`) Key due to Conflicts with Game Functions

### Fixes:

* Fixed KeyBinds Triggering when trying to type or on a focused GUI element

* Compatibility Fixes for Scroll List Issues

### More Information:

#### Command Rewrite Info:

Starting In v1.5.0, Commands for CraftPresence are now within a new menu of the Config Gui.

Along with this rewrite, take note of the following:

* Tab Completion will only work for the most likely suggestion, and will only suggest for more then two characters in a word.

* Only CraftPresence Commands, started with /cp or /craftpresence are Supported!

* At this time, in 1.13.2 and 1.14, The Config GUI can only open in-game due to an unknown issue.

This GUI is subject to improve as future updates are released.
