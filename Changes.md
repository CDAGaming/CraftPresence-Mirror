Some 1.14.x, 1.15.x, and 1.16.x Ports of this Mod Require the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and contains the same differences as the 1.13.x Port

#### Snapshot Build Info

Some Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.

Any Snapshot Build Released will be marked as BETA to match its Snapshot Status depending on Tests done before release and issues found.

Snapshot Builds, depending on circumstances, may also contain changes for a future version of the mod, and will be noted as so if this is the case.

#### Legacy Build Info (Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Below)

Ports of this Mod for Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Lower are on very limited support.

Please Keep in Mind the Following:

*   There is NO Support for Server RPC Displays from MC 1.2.5 and Below, due to modding limitations.
*   Bugs that relate with or are caused by issues in the Vanilla Codebase, are unlikely able to be fixed due to MC's limitations
