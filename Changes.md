#### Snapshot Build Info

Some Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.

Any Snapshot Build released will be marked as **ALPHA** to match its Snapshot Status depending on tests done before
release
and issues found.

Snapshot Builds, depending on circumstances, may also contain changes for a future version of the mod, and will be noted
as so if this is the case with the `-Staging` label.
