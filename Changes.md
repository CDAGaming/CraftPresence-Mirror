### More Information

#### Known Issues

Despite configuration compatibility being ensured between v1.8.x/v1.9.x and v2.0,
caution is advised to ensure the best experience, while also baring in mind that features can be adjusted, removed, or
added/iterated upon between releases.

The following known issues are present in this build:

* On certain MC versions, Scrolling while in a Scroll List drawing `ItemStack`'s may cause GUI distortions
* Text with colors do not retain those colors if that text moves to a newline in the CraftPresence UIs
* The HypherionMC Config Layer (To Convert a Simple RPC config to CraftPresence) contains the following known issues:
    * Placeholders related to the realm event are currently unimplemented and parse as `{''}`.

#### Snapshot Build Info

Some Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.

Any Snapshot Build released will be marked as **ALPHA** to match its Snapshot Status depending on tests done before
release
and issues found.

Snapshot Builds, depending on circumstances, may also contain changes for a future version of the mod, and will be noted
as so if this is the case with the `-Staging` label.
