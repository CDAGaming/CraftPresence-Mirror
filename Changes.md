#### 1.14.x Build Info:

The 1.14.x Port of this Mod Requires the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric) and contains the same differences as the 1.13.x Port

This Version of the Build is based on Minecraft Snapshots, since 1.14 is not fully released, caution is advised.

A 1.14.x Snapshot Build will expire upon the release of a succeeding build. (Ex: 19w04b is Released, then 19w04a is removed)
